Many of these extend, chronologically, beyond the end of slavery. Being a free person of color ceased to have legal meaning after emancipation and the passage of the 13th Amendment, but having been a member of that class continued to have cultural, racial, social, economic, and political implications for those who had been free people of color in the antebellum period, and for generations of their descendants. For this reason, we have chosen to digitize  entire collections and not set an arbitrary cut-off date for materials.</p><p> </p><p>Because of the relative dearth lack of personal and family papers for free people of color, public records are a particularly important source for researchers. This project will digitize significant collections of public records  from the New Orleans Public Library’s Louisiana Division, including a  four-volume “Register of free persons of color entitled to remain in the state”  (1840-1864), four different collections of emancipation records, which often  include testimony regarding why the slave was deserving of freedom and provide other information about the slave and slave owner, and an extensive collection of indenture records (1809-1843) in which at least one participant (the person being indentured, his/her sponsor, or the artisan/merchant to whom the servant was being bound) was a free person of color.</p><p> </p><p>Finally, many items have been selected for digitization from larger collections that are not primarily related to free  people of color. Bringing these items together from the disparate collections in which they exist will facilitate comparison and help to provide a larger body of information for researchers about the norms of living conditions and race relations for free people of color during the colonial and antebellum eras. </p><p> </p><p></p>

p16313coll20	Germany’s Wild Medicinal Plants (Deutschlands wildwachsende Arzney-Pflanzen)	<p>Monroe Library’s Special Collections and Archives is proud to display reproductions from one of the most beautiful volumes in our collection, Deutschlands wildwachsende Arzney-Pflanzen by German botanist Johann Gottlieb Mann. Published in 1828, Deutschlands wildwachsende Arzney-Pflanzen (Germany’s Wild Medicinal Plants) contains hand-colored lithographs of medical plants, flowers, and fruits. Following the illustrations is the Latin name and German description for each plant. </p><p>In the introduction to the volume, Mann states that his goal in publishing the work was two-fold: to present a collection of realistic drawings of medicinal plants for the use of doctors, veterinarians and pharmacists who would not otherwise have the time or opportunity to study the plants in nature, and to give a simple and precise description of the plants along with where they may be found and when they are in season. Mann’s illustrations transcend their original, utilitarian purpose of assisting medical professionals, however; they are works of art.</p><p>This digital collection includes selections of illustrations from the book. To view the book in its entirety, contact Loyola University Special Collections & Archives at archives@loyno.edu.</p>

The letters are primarily addressed to Rosalie Gottlieb, Moyse's future wife. The collection also contains letters from Moyse to his parents, Simon and Flora Moyse, and siblings, as well as letters from various friends and fellow soldiers. Moyse earned a Bachelor of Arts degree from Louisiana State University in 1910 and a Bachelor of Law degree in 1912, after which he worked for the law firm of Cross and Moyse in Baton Rouge. Gottlieb, a Baton Rouge native, and daughter of Joseph and Rebecca (Hahn) Gottlieb, received a Bachelor of Arts degree from LSU in 1918.</p><p> </p><p>Moyse was one of the first volunteers from Louisiana to join the World War I effort, enlisting in the Army's First Officers Training Camp in 1917. Commissioned as a first lieutenant, Moyse was deployed to the Alsace sector, where he was severely wounded in trench warfare during the Aisne-Marne offensive on July 21, 1918. After months of convalescence, he returned to active duty as the assistant to the adjutant general of the Service of Supply at Tours, France. Moyse was honorably discharged in 1919 and was awarded the Distinguished Service Cross, the Purple Heart, and the French Croix de Guerre with Palm. Upon returning to Louisiana he was promoted to captain in the Reserve Corps of the United States Army. Moyse was active in local patriotic groups and during World War II served as state commander of the Louisiana Department of the American Legion.</p><p> </p><p>Moyse and Gottlieb married on September 30, 1920. The couple had two children, Hermann, Jr., and Betty. From 1921 to 1924, Moyse represented East Baton Rouge Parish in the state legislature. He worked as an attorney for the City National Bank in Baton Rouge from its inception in 1933 and became its vice-president and trust officer in 1946. He also served in various capacities with the Chamber of Commerce, the Red Cross, and other civic groups.</p><p> </p><p>The letters cover the period Moyse spent at Citizens Training Camp at Fort Logan H. Roots in Arkansas, Camp MacArthur in Waco, TX, as well as his brief stay in New York before he left for France. The majority of the letters are from his time in France, during which he writes to Gottlieb about his experiences with his fellow soldiers as well as his interaction with French people he encountered during his deployment. Moyse writes fondly of the French, for whom he has a great admiration of their stoic nature in a time of grave crisis and hardship.</p>
HIC	Higgins Industries	<p>Collection Description</p><p> </p><p>For nearly thirty years, the boat building company founded by Andrew Jackson Higgins was an important fixture in New Orleans. What began as a sideline to the petroleum industry in 1930 soon developed into a thriving commercial concern.  Higgins specialized in shallow-draft boats suitable to the bayous of Louisiana.  With World War II that reputation enabled Higgins Industries to become one of the largest manufacturers of U. S. naval combat boats during World War II.  The ability of the company to design and produce vessels in record time meant that during the war they produced 20,094 boats, employing 20,000 workers at seven plants in the New Orleans area.  Their most famous vehicles were the landing craft used during the Normandy Invasion on D-Day, which prompted General Eisenhower to remark that Andrew Higgins "won the war for us."</p><p> </p><p>The diagrams in this collection are of Motor Torpedo Boats (MTB), better  known as PT boats, which formed a major part of the company's war  effort.  From 1939-1945 the U. S. Navy purchased or contracted for 808  of these boats, generally in squadron-sized groups of twelve.  Of these,  Higgins Industries built or contracted to deliver 221: Nos. 5-6, 70,  and 564 (Hellcat) were prototypes; 71-94; 197-254; 265-313; 450-485;  625-660; and 791-802 were series, or "classes" of contracts.  The  contracts for Nos. 797-808 were cancelled in the latter half of 1945 and  these boats were never completed.  Most of the plans in this collection  applied either to an entire class (designated by the number of the  first boat in each group: e.g. Series 265; Series 450; Series 625), or a  subset thereof (e.g. 199-210).</p><p> </p><p>Browse All Items in the Higgins Collection</p><p> </p><p>Browse by Keyword</p><p> </p><p>To refine your search, click "Advanced Search" at the top of the page.</p>

In personal correspondence, also  from Tulane's Special Collections, Long compares his efforts to enact  "old age" pensions with FDR's efforts at the national level.   Transportation maps provided by the Louisiana State Museum illustrate  the results of Long's massive road-building program.  Opposition to  Long's programs is documented by newspaper articles, broadsides and  legislative appeals sponsored by a variety of Louisiana political and  economic groups including Standard Oil and the Louisiana Women's  Committee.  Of particular note, from THNOC manuscript holdings, a couple  of letters from author Ezra Pound related to Long's death speak to the  worldwide implications of this event and perceptions that Long's views  that were progressive and important.

p120701coll29	Isidore Newman School Archives	<p>Collection Description</p><p> Isidore Newman School is an independent, co-educational, college preparatory school located in uptown New Orleans. The school was founded in 1903 with the gift of local philanthropist Isidore Newman, who wanted to provide a superior education to the boys and girls living in the nearby Jewish Orphans Home. The school employed an education method called manual training, and was therefore called Isidore Newman Manual Training School, or "Manual". Its motto is Discimus Agere Agendo, or "We learn to do by doing". The initial curriculum combined academics with training in wood and iron work, sewing, cooking, and household management. Newman stipulated that the school be open to all children regardless of religion or social background. By 1931 the school had become college preparatory and changed its name to Isidore Newman School.</p><p></p><p>Isidore Newman School's archives span over one hundred years and contain materials historically significant to the history of New Orleans, the Manual Training Movement in education, and to the story of immigrants finding prosperity in America, a central theme in our country's history.</p><p> </p><p>The archives contain relics and photographs relating to Isidore Newman, his wife, Rebecca Kieffer Newman, and their descendants. There are student publications such as the Pioneer and the Greenie, the former of which was founded in 1911 and is the oldest continuously published student magazine in Louisiana.

p15140coll31	Judge John Minor Wisdom Collection	<p>John Minor Wisdom (1905-1999) was hailed as "a giant among federal judges during the tumultuous years that saw official segregation end in the South and civil rights at last extended to black Americans." Born in New Orleans, he attended Isidore Newman School and graduated from Washington and Lee University. In 1925 Wisdom went to Harvard University to study English literature, but a year later he returned to New Orleans and entered Tulane University Law School. He graduated first in his class in 1929 and was admitted to the bar. Later he and a former classmate, Saul Stone, founded the law firm which eventually became Stone, Pigman, Walther, Wittman and Hutchinson. While in private practice, he distinguished himself as an expert on trusts and was largely responsible for the adoption of Louisiana's new trust code.</p><p>During World War II, Wisdom served as a captain in the Army and later as lieutenant colonel in the Office of Legal Procurement. President Harry Truman rewarded his war service with the Legion of Merit. An active member of the Republican Party, he was instrumental in securing Dwight D. Eisenhower's nomination for the presidency in 1952. In 1957 Eisenhower appointed him to the 5th Circuit, which then included Mississippi, Texas, Alabama, Florida, and Georgia, as well as Louisiana. Wisdom aligned himself with three other 5th Circuit judges to form "The Four," a coalition that pressed consistently for black rights.</p><p>In 1977 Wisdom changed his status from active judge to senior judge, which relieved him of administrative duties but allowed him to continue to hear cases and write opinions. From 1975 until his death, he was a judge for the special court created under the Regional Rail Reorganization Act of 1973. He received many accolades, including honorary degrees from Tulane, Harvard, and San Diego universities and Oberlin and Middlebury colleges. Despite his support for civil rights, Wisdom maintained his memberships in the all-white Boston Club and Louisiana Club, explaining, "I can't change their minds, and they can't change my mind. They respect me, and I probably help the situation a little by not getting out of those clubs."</p><p>Wisdom's association with those organizations may have stimulated his interest in the New Orleans Mardi Gras memorabilia found in the Judge John Minor Wisdom Collection. Mardi Gras has been commemorated in Louisiana at least since 1699. In the 1850s the celebration fell into disrepute, but on February 24, 1857, the Mistick Krewe of Comus staged its first street parade, giving rise to the New Orleans carnival that we know today. During the last quarter of the nineteenth century, carnival organizations vied with each other to produce colorful, elaborately illustrated invitations to their balls and other ephemera.</p><p>Source: Pope, John.

p120701coll9	Lafcadio Hearn Correspondence	<p>Lafcadio Hearn was a writer during the closing decades of the nineteenth century and the opening years of the twentieth. His writings--fiction and nonfiction alike--typically drew on his firsthand observations of life in what were then considered exotic places: New Orleans, the West Indies, and Japan. The Lafcadio Hearn Collection at Loyola University New Orleans consists primarily of letters written by Hearn to Page Baker. Baker was the editor of the Times-Democrat when Hearn worked for that newspaper; he was also a steadfast champion of Hearn's literary ambitions. Hearn wrote Baker from various places--New Orleans, the West Indies, and Japan. In these letters, which ranged from one paragraph to many pages, Hearn touched on many subjects, including his work at the Times-Democrat, his literary efforts, and his travels. </p>

This corpus highlights Louisiana's strong cultural, linguistic, and social ties with France.</p><p> </p><p>The goal of this ongoing project is to enhance access to rare and understudied French documents held in the Special Collections by providing images of the original documents along with transcriptions in the Louisiana Digital Library. For the initial selection, Dr. Carole Salmon chose approximately 40 documents, mostly manuscripts, taking into consideration factors such as the author's profession and social status in France following the French Revolution.</p><p> </p><p>The French Revolution was an event of tremendous importance, and one which had profound impact on most of the world. Outside of Europe this was especially true of the French Caribbean colonies, and the Spanish colony of Louisiana. Many Louisianians felt a great attachment to France, and throughout the Spanish reign pushed to have the colony retroceded. After the revolution, particularly after the publication of Citizen Edmund Charles Genet's 1792 pamphlet calling for uprising (and promising French support), it looked as though those discontented with Spanish rule might have cause for celebration. Alas, though French revolutionary influence played a factor in several small revolts and demonstrations across the colony from New Orleans to Natchez, it did not lead to successful revolution, or force a retrocession from Spanish hands back to the French. Indeed, the colony did not retrocede until nearly a decade later in 1800.</p><p> </p><p>The Lettres de Louisiane collection demonstrates the depth of connection felt by many Louisianians to France. The French identifying people of New Orleans demonstrated in the streets during the years immediately following the Revolution. Songs were invented and plays staged that contained themes of popular uprising and even the execution of royals and the Spanish regime. At the same time, however, there were royalists and French refugees, particularly from the French colony of St. Dominque, taking up residence in the city as well. Fear of slave revolt, fresh in the memory of the St. Domingue refugees, had a chilling effect on the willingness of the French planters to throw their lot in with the agitators in the city.</p><p>Louisiana Early English Corpus</p><p>Early Louisiana French Correspondence</p>
