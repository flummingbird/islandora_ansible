LPC	Louisiana Purchase and Louisiana Colonial History	No description
lapur	Louisiana Purchase Bicentennial Collection	<p></p><p> </p><p>The Louisiana Purchase in 1803 stands as the most significant event in the westward expansion of the United States and as an experiment to incorporate a substantially different culture. It was the beginning of the meeting of multi-cultural frontiers. The Louisiana Purchase changed what the United States had been and had a profound effect on what the United States would become. By 2003, this digital collection will provide materials for modern researchers - from the middle school student to the adult scholar or lifelong learner - to study the complex process of opening the West from the points of view of the diverse heritage, peoples, and cultures involved. Eventually more than 25,000 pages of materials will be made available through this project.</p><p>The new territories of the Louisiana Purchase presented a significant challenge to the primarily Anglo-Protestant, adolescent United States of America. The southernmost part of the Louisiana Purchase was in effect a foreign country. Many of its inhabitants were Mediterranean, Caribbean, and African in origin. Most were Catholic, spoke different languages, and had a different view of government, law, and race. Louisiana was a richly multi-cultural frontier in which different ethnic groups jostled for power and primacy. Creoles of French and Spanish descent, Germans upriver from New Orleans, English settlers in what would become the Florida parishes, Acadians to the west of the metropolis, free people of color, slaves, and Native Americans would interact with the new waves of "Americans" from states such as Tennessee and Kentucky. Indeed the Louisiana Purchase started the United States' encounter with diversity that has continued throughout the nineteenth and twentieth centuries.</p><p>Then as now, diversity brought about conflicts, some of which ended in accommodation and the realization that from diversity comes strength. Most ethnic groups were distrustful of the others. Louisiana's history as a colony, territory, and state in the fifteen years from 1800 to 1815 was characterized by diplomatic, political, legal, and cultural friction and accommodation among the various elements of its diverse population. Included during the period were the following momentous events or movements: the Louisiana Purchase (1803); the creation of the Territory of Orleans (1804); a massive immigration of French, African slaves, and free people of color from Saint Domingue to New Orleans (1809); the largest slave revolt in U.S. history in St. Charles and St. John parishes (1811); statehood (1812); the Creek War (1813-14); and the Battle of New Orleans (1815). By the time of the Battle of New Orleans in 1815, at the end of the War of 1812, the national experiment in colonialism had become a success. The battle served as a means of uniting the inhabitants in a common cause. Soldiers from Tennessee and Kentucky fought alongside Creoles, Acadians, free men of color, and Choctaw Indians. The battle was a great military victory and the United States' most multi-ethnic endeavor to that time.</p><p>The materials in this collection consist of primary sources that document the heritage, peoples and cultures of the area that was to become the state of Louisiana during a critical and tumultuous period in its history, 1800-1815. These sources come from the Louisiana and Lower Mississippi Valley Collections of the Louisiana State University Libraries, and the New Orleans City Archives and Louisiana Collection of the New Orleans Public Library. The project is a partnership with these two libraries and the LSU Digital Library and has been funded by a grant from the Institute of Museum and Library Services.</p><p>The sources include books published in or about Louisiana during the period (with a few reminiscences of the period that were published later), including travel accounts, political tracts, and scientific and religious works. Materials also include maps ranging from original plans of Baton Rouge and New Orleans to sketchier depictions of the Louisiana frontier; pamphlets and government records and publications documenting the Louisiana Purchase in 1803 and the Battle of New Orleans in 1815, two pivotal events that frame the period; French-language pamphlets depicting society and commerce; and manuscripts. The manuscripts include letters and official documents of government officials and bodies, family papers of Louisiana residents, and accounts of travelers. Many of the documents deal with New Orleans, which was then the largest city in the South and the nation's second largest port. Others reflect events in the geographic area that would become the state of Louisiana in 1812, as well as the vast new western areas claimed by the United States. All the materials document the remarkable cultural and ethnic heritage of Louisiana during this period.</p>

p16313coll77	Louisiana State University Agricultural Experiment Station Reports	<p> </p><p> </p><p>The LSU Agricultural Experiment Station was established in 1885 as a sugar research station funded by the Louisiana Sugar Planters Association. The station’s purpose was "to develop and improve the agricultural interests and resources of Louisiana, especially the cultivation of sugarcane and rice by scientific and agricultural and chemical experiments and to disseminated information connected therewith." With the passage of the federal Hatch Act of 1887, agriculture research at land grant universities established throughout the US. Today, the Louisiana Agricultural Experiment Station serves as the research arm of the LSU AgCenter. It is composed of academic departments and research stations across Louisiana. Scientists at research stations develop new knowledge and technologies to help agricultural producers provide citizens of the state and the nation with a vast array of food, fiber, and fuel. More information about the Louisiana Agricultural Experiment Station can be found here: http://www.lsuagcenter.com/en/administration/about_us/research/ </p><p> </p><p>The digitization of the LSU Agricultural Experiment Station bulletins was funded through Project Ceres, a program that supports the ongoing preservation and digitization of collections in the field of agriculture.

p16313coll28	Loyola University New Orleans University Photographs Collection	<p>The Loyola University New Orleans University Photographs Collection is comprised of photographs dating back to the early 20th century from Loyola's University Archives. Early photographs include some taken by famed New Orleans photographer E.J. Bellocq. Since 1949, the university has employed an official photographer. While a large part of the photographs in the collection come from these university employees, many photographs in the collection are unidentified. When the photographer is known, photos will be credited to that person. Unidentified photos will be credited to the university.</p><p> </p><p>Russ Cresson was the university photographer from 1949 to 1987. A native New Orleanian and a 1938 graduate of Warren Easton High School, Cresson served in the Navy in the Pacific during World War II. In 1946 he joined the wave of veterans entering Loyola on the GI Bill.  While pursuing a degree in business and playing on the Wolfpack baseball team, he began working as the unofficial university photographer, taking pictures for the yearbook and The Maroon and photographing campus and administrative activities.  When he graduated in 1949, Loyola hired him as its first full-time university photographer. In 1983 he received the Coadjutor Optimus, given annually to an outstanding member of the university staff, and in 2004 he received the Adjutor Hominum, which is presented by the alumni association to an outstanding alumnus.</p><p> </p><p>As an undergraduate, Tracy Smith served as assistant to Cresson, assuming the position of University Photographer after Cresson's retirement. Smith served as University Photographer from 1987-1989.</p><p> </p><p>In 1989 Harold Baquet became Loyola’s university photographer. He was born in Charity Hospital, grew up first in the Treme and then in the Seventh Ward, attended Corpus Christi school and church, and graduated from St. Augustine High School. As a young man he plunged into the profession as an independent photojournalist.  A few years later he became the official photographer to the Mayor of the City of New Orleans, a position he held from 1984 to 1989 under Ernest N. Morial and then Sidney J. Barthelemy. With the possible exception of the university president, no figure on campus is better known or more respected than Baquet.  Befitting his many contributions and his dedication to the university’s mission, Loyola presented him with two of its highest awards:  the Coadjutor Optimus in 2002 and the President’s Medal in 2010.</p><p> </p><p>Photographs from the Dr. Edward Wynne Photograph Collection are also included. Dr. Edward W. Wynne was an Arts & Science graduate of Loyola University in 1939. According to his son, Michael D. Wynne, Dr. Wynne was the school’s photographer during the late 1930s.</p>

LMP	Maps of Louisiana Collection	<p></p><p>This collection consists of historically important original maps associated with the French colonization of the territory of Louisiana, and the Louisiana Purchase. Maps included were created by Nicholas de Fer, Guillaume de L'Isle (1675-1726), Jacques Nicholas Bellin (1703-1772), Le Page du Pratz (d. 1775), Jean Baptiste Bourguignon d'Anville (1697-1782), Jan Jansson (1588-1664), Jean Baptiste Nolin (1686-1762), Guillaume Danet, William Faden (1750?-1836), Abraham Ortelius (1527-1598), and others. They are contained within LSU Libraries' Special Collections.Geographically, the maps trace the exploratory voyages of Pierre Le Moyne d'Iberville (1661-1706), beginning in France, continuing to Saint Domingiue, Cuba, the northern coast of the Gulf of Mexico, up the Mississippi River to the Village of Natchez, back to the Dry Tortugas, and con cluding with the Bahama Passage.Historically, these selected maps document the leading role of the French in deriving the first accurate maps of the New World. These voyages were part of the French effort to 1) accurately remeasure the shape of the globe from north to south, 2) systematically determine accurate longitudes from astronomical observations associated with the opening of the Paris observatory in 1672, and 3) explore the world. Because of this scientific undertaking, Guillaume de L'Isle is known as the first modern cartographer, Jean Baptiste Bourguignon d'Anville is credited with facilitating European penetration of Africa and of North America through the Great Lakes, and Jacques Nicholas Bellin is associated with the first modern hydrographic surveys and sea-atlases of the world. (Skelton, 1958)As Louisiana is on the eve of the tricentennial of d'Iberville's founding of the colony of Louisiana, and near the eve of the bicentennial of the Louisiana Purchase, the presentation of these maps online is a timely contribution by Louisiana State University to the commemeration of these historical events. The maps are of immense ecological, historical, and social interest, and constitute a unique interdisciplinary online resource.The French Colonization of Louisiana and Louisiana Purchase Map Collection was coordinated and selected by Dr. Richard E. Condry, Associate Professor, Coastal Fisheries Institute, Louisiana State University.Visit the David Rumesy Collection to search for and view additional, historical maps.Skelton, R. A. 1958.

p16313coll37	Mesoamerican Painted Manuscripts at the Latin American Library	<p>The Latin American Library at Tulane University is home to one of the premier collections of original Mexican pictorial manuscripts found within the United States. These treasures, along with extensive holdings of rare books, other original manuscript collections, comprehensive holdings of facsimile editions of other codices, and other scholarly research materials and primary sources, distinguish it as one of the world’s foremost collections for the study of Mesoamerican writing systems and painted manuscripts, pre-Columbian culture, and early Colonial Mexican history and society.</p><p> </p><p>The digital collection, Mesoamerican Painted Manuscripts at the Latin American Library, presents images of the Library’s holdings of original and rare copies of Mexican manuscripts painted in the native pictorial tradition. They are painted on a variety of materials such as animal hide, maguey, amate or fig bark paper, linen, and European paper; their content dates to the early contact period (A.D. 1500 to 1700). The texts collected here represent a variety of themes: Aztec history and migrations, land claims and grants, property holdings, census data, fiscal and tribute accounts, and royal Mixtec genealogies.</p><p> </p><p>The early Contact period in Mexico was a time of rapid culture change, loss, and transformation during which much of pre-Columbian culture, particularly the arts, ideology, language, and religion, meshed with that of the Spanish colonists and the Roman Catholic clergy. The scribal tradition and writing systems of indigenous Mesoamerican civilizations also persisted and became amalgamated with the European scribal arts implanted along with the rest of Spanish colonial society.</p><p> </p><p>Prior to contact, Mesoamerican scribes were highly skilled intellectuals, craftsmen, and priests, who were literate and likely multilingual. Examples of their work that have survived from this period show that they were very adept at learning new languages and scripts, writing conventions, and meeting the distinct demands of a Western colonial society for secular written documents. The painted manuscripts in the Latin American Library’s collection presented here in digital form represent important dimensions of this syncretic process.</p><p> </p><p>La Biblioteca Latinoamericana de Tulane alberga una de las colecciones de manuscritos pictográficos originales mexicanos más importantes de los Estados Unidos. Estos tesoros, aunados a una notable colección de impresos raros y curiosos, manuscritos coloniales originales, ediciones facsimilares de otros códices, y otras fuentes primarias y secundarias hacen de esta colección una de las más significativas del mundo para el estudio de los sistemas de escritura y los manuscritos pictóricos indígenas mesoamericanos, así como de las culturas precolombinas y el período colonial mexicano en general.</p><p> </p><p>La colección Manuscritos pictóricos mesoamericanos de la Biblioteca Latinoamericana ofrece imágenes digitales de los manuscritos originales y copias facsimilares raras de estilo pictográfico de los indígenas de México central. Los manuscritos se remontan a los siglos XVI y XVII, y están dibujados en diversas superficies, como piel de venado, papel de maguey, amate, e higo, tela de lino, y papel europeo. Está representada gran variedad de temas: la historia azteca y sus migraciones; pleitos y concesiones de tierras; disposición de propiedades; censos; cuentas fiscales y de tributo; y genealogías reales de familias mixtecas.</p><p> </p><p>La llegada de los españoles a México inició una etapa de acelerados cambios, pérdidas, y transformaciones culturales. Fue durante esta etapa que gran parte de las culturas prehispánicas, sobre todo sus expresiones artísticas, ideologías, idiomas, y religiones se fundieron con la de los colonizadores y clérigos católicos europeos. La tradición escribana y los sistemas autóctonos de escritura de las civilizaciones mesoamericanas también perduraron, mezclándose con las tradiciones europeas que fueron implantadas con el resto de la cultura española colonial.</p><p> </p><p>Antes de la llegada de los españoles, los escribanos mesoamericanos ya se insertaban dentro de una notable tradición, desempeñándose como intelectuales de gran refinación, artesanos de alta calidad, y sacerdotes, todos letrados y probablemente plurilingües. Las muestras de sus obras que han sobrevivido hasta hoy demuestran que fueron muy hábiles para aprender idiomas y escrituras nuevas, incorporando convenciones de escrituras foráneas, para cumplir con las demandas de una sociedad occidental colonial en la producción de formas de escritura laicas. Los manuscritos que conserva la Biblioteca Latinoamericana y presentados aquí en forma digital representan dimensiones importantes de este complejo proceso de sincretismo.</p><p> </p><p>This collection is best viewed with a browser other than Firefox.

p16313coll15	Mexican Incunabula (1559-1600) at the Latin American Library	<p>The first printing press in the New World is established in Mexico City in 1539. Because printing was concevied by the Spaniards as a tool for missionaries in the Christianization of Indian populations, these early imprints consisted primarily of grammars and vocabularies of native Indian languages, as well as instructional religious tracts. This collection provides digitized images of some of the earliest products of Mexican printing presses (1539-1600). In addition to making available some of the earliest imprints produced in the New World, this collection provides important and rare sources for the study of the first phases of the Spanish enterprise in the New World, as well as initial forms of encounter between Native Americans and Europeans. These works also provide valuable insights into native languages and cultures during the first decades of contact. Early Mexican imprints are quite rare, and the Latin American Library houses nine of these titles. The total number of pages is approximately 2600. The texts are in Spanish, Purépecha and Nahuatl.</p><p>The Mexican Incunabula at the Latin American Library (1559-1600) collection represents the Latin American Library’s contribution to a larger project called Impresos Mexicanos del Siglo XVI initiated by a small group of institutions in the United States and Mexico. The goal of the project is to create an on-line digital collection of early Mexican imprints that will include at least one copy of the existing 136 titles and as many additional versions of each as possible. The Primeros Libros de las Américas collection available at http://www.primeroslibros.org continues to grow as partner institutions join the project.</p><p> </p><p>En 1539, se estableció  la primera imprenta del Nuevo Mundo en México.  Dado que los españoles consideraban la imprenta como instrumento para la evangelización de los pueblos indígenas, estos primeros impresos consistían principalmente en gramáticas y vocabularios de idiomas nativos y tratados didácticos religiosos.  La colección Mexican Incunabula at the Latin American Library (1559-1600)[Impresos Incunables Mexicanos (1559-1600) de la Biblioteca Latinoamericana] ofrece copias digitales en formato pdf de estos primeros productos de la imprenta  mexicana (1539-1600).  Además de hacer disponibles en forma digital algunos de los primeros impresos del Nuevo Mundo, esta colección representa una fuente indispensable para el estudio de la primera fase de la empresa española en el Nuevo Mundo.  Estas obras ofrecen también valiosos aportes sobre los primeros contactos entre indígenas y europeos, y también sobre las culturas e idiomas indígenas en estas primeras décadas.  Los  incunables mexicanos son obras sumamente raras.  De los 220  títulos identificados, se han identificado apenas 136 títulos en repositorios del mundo entero.   Nueve de estos impresos se encuentran en el acervo de la Biblioteca Latinoamericana.  En total, estos nueve incunables contienen aproximadamente 2.600 páginas.  Los textos están en español, purépecha, y náhuatl.</p><p>Esta colección también representa la contribución de la Biblioteca Latinoamericana al proyecto llamado Impreso Mexicanos del Siglo XVI que se realizó un grupo de siete instituciones en los Estados Unidos y México.

LSU_MRF	Mississippi River Flood of 1927 Photograph Album	<p>The Mississippi River Flood of 1927 Album is a visual record of one of the worst natural disasters to occur in the U. S. The flood took the lives of thousands, made refugees of hundreds of thousands, and caused vast destruction. The photo album was prepared for O. K. Allen (1882-1936), Chairman, Louisiana Highway Commission and later Governor, and presumably used for securing Federal disaster aid. This album became the property of George Cobb Everett (1885-1946) who served on the LSU Board Supervisors and was member of the committee sent to Washington, D. C. in 1927 to secure federal funds for rebuilding destroyed roads and bridges. Most of the photographs are identified as the work of Baton Rouge photographer Jasper G. Ewing. Some of the photographs were published in the Fourth Biennial Report of the Louisiana Highway Commission of the State of Louisiana, 1926-1928 (TE 24 L8A2).The album contains 214 black and white photographs showing flood damage to roads, bridges, and buildings primarily in the Atchafalaya River region and the town of Melville, Louisiana. The photos include depictions of repair crews, levees, barges, crevasses, and railroads. Some photos pre-date the flood and a few depict scenes from non-flooded areas. The album includes a photostatic copy of the first check for one-half the amount of federal disaster money paid to Louisiana and a newspaper clipping concerning Louisiana's implementation of the first gasoline tax. </p>

MSW	Native Flora of Louisiana - Watercolor drawings by Margaret Stones	<p> </p><p>The Native Flora of Louisiana Collection contains watercolor drawings by world-renowned botanical artist Margaret Stones. The collection began in 1976, when Louisiana State University commissioned six watercolor drawings to celebrate the American bicentennial and the 50th anniversary of LSU's Baton Rouge campus (Stones xv; Zdanowicz 15). University officials hoped these drawings would combine art and science to create a "record of Louisiana's lush, varied, and beautiful flora" (Stones xv).  Based on the popularity of the original six drawings, LSU decided to expand the Native Flora of Louisiana project to include 200 more drawings. Stones completed these drawings in 1987, and she continued to produce drawings on a yearly contract basis until 1989. The Native Flora of Louisiana project currently numbers 224 drawings, all of which are housed in LSU Libraries Special Collections Hill Memorial Library along with other published works by Stones (Stones ix-xv).

p15140coll39	Newcomb College Scrapbooks	<p>Scrapbooks inhabit an uneasy place in the world of print. Unique artifacts created most often from mass-produced text and images, they often find no comfortable resting place in the private home, the selves of libraries, or the boxes of archives.  Digital imaging make scrapbooks accessible from disparate locations but also provide in many ways an easier way of handling bulky pages filled to the brim with documents. </p><p> </p><p>Newcomb College long preserved some of the scrapbooks of its students in a vault on the historic women's campus. The scrapbooks today form one of the cornerstones to the Newcomb Archives and especially show the trajectories of lives in the period 1900-1945.  The women sought to document diverse experiences. While no two albums are alike, the majority of the collection covers topics such as college athletics, plays and films, the city of New Orleans, social life, and academics.  In addition, various albums such as that of Mary Jane Conover and Anne Crichton document travel while those of other scrapbook makers preserve memorabilia from summer camps, debutante parties, weddings, and political marches. </p>

The 249-acre exposition opened late and already in debt, while the exhibits were not all completed until March 1885. The Main Building, the largest exhibit building on the grounds and the largest wooden structure in the world at the time, held exhibits from 30 countries. The Government & States Building hosted exhibits from 45 states and territories, as well as U.S. Government exhibits occupying one third of the floor space.</p><p> </p><p>Horticultural Hall, housing the horticultural and agricultural displays and constructed entirely of glass and wood, was the world's largest structure of its type. The Art Hall opened in February 1885 and proved a success with critics. A total of 1,158,840 visitors were counted as having entered the grounds, far below the estimated 4 million that had been projected. The exposition closed $470,000 in debt. </p><p> </p><p> This collection consists of 65 stereoscopic photographs of exhibition buildings, exhibit booths, and other city buildings taken during the World's Industrial and Cotton Centennial Exposition held in New Orleans, La., in 1884-1885.

p16313coll68	NOLA Hip Hop and Bounce Archive	<p>List of Artists</p><p> </p><p>For more than three decades now, hiphop and bounce music traditions in New Orleans have been central outlets for creativity, celebration, social critique, community gathering, and political and expressive art in the city. From the groundbreaking, internationally recognized Cash Money and No Limit record labels to the strong currents of underground hiphop and street rap that sustain the tradition, New Orleans has been a recognized hiphop locale since the 1990s. Meanwhile, the indigenous New Orleans bounce music tradition, born at block parties, dance clubs, and other community gatherings, had until very recently been little heard outside the city. Since Hurricane Katrina, bounce has become a force of its own, gaining massive popularity and influence internationally via artists like Big Freedia, Katey Red and Nicky da B (1990-2014), though its roots go back well over two decades.</p><p> </p><p>Perhaps more audibly so than rappers anywhere else in America, New Orleans artists have pulled from the musical traditions of the city’s past. Far from rejecting the musical and cultural traditions of earlier generations, early New Orleans rappers in particular often incorporated elements of them––including brass-band street-parade instrumentations/rhythms and Mardi Gras Indian chants and melodies––into the hip-hop collage. Today, rap music is Louisiana’s most lucrative cultural export. But in the most widespread images of “New Orleans music,” the city’s incredibly influential and successful rappers, producers and DJs that helped to build the tradition remain largely invisible. This, coupled with the realities of Hurricane Katrina, in which countless members of the city’s creative communities lost their lives or were displaced, many of whom remain unable to return, inspired a determination in many to help provide resources/further acknowledgment for artists and to document/collect hiphop and bounce oral histories and ephemera. The NOLA Hiphop and Bounce Archive hopes to be one of many initiatives assisting in such efforts. As the nation’s oldest, largest, and arguably most comprehensive independent archives/library documenting the modern Civil Rights Movement, the Amistad Research Center is playing a central role in helping to facilitate the development and growth of this collection. While the collection hopes to expand to include further materials from a variety of artists, collectors, and collaborators in the near future, the NOLA Hiphop and Bounce Archive collection launches with materials from the Where They At bounce and hip-hop collection and the NOLA Hiphop Archive. </p><p> </p><p>The Where They At project was begun in 2008 by photographer Aubrey Edwards and journalist Alison Fensterstock, with the assistance of a grant from the Greater New Orleans Foundation. It collects over 50 photographic portraits and audio interviews with New Orleans rappers, DJs, producers, photographers, label owners, promoters, record store personnel, journalists and other parties involved in the New Orleans hip-hop and bounce scene from the late 1980’s through Hurricane Katrina, as well as ephemera including original fliers, posters, vintage photographs and an extensive collection of record, CD and cassette tape scans. In a multimedia exhibition form, Where They At was presented at the Smithsonian-affiliated Ogden Museum of Southern Art, the New Orleans Jazz and Heritage Festival, Austin’s Birdhouse Gallery and SXSW festival, Minneapolis’ Soap Factory, New York City’s Abrons Art Center and the Direktorenhaus in Berlin, Germany.</p><p> </p><p>The NOLA Hiphop Archive was founded by Holly Hobbs in 2012. To date, the NOLA Hiphop Archive has focused on the recording and collection of digital videotaped oral histories. The collection currently contains over 40 videotaped interviews with leading hiphop and bounce artists, with new interviews added on an ongoing basis. We are thankful to the donors to our Kickstarter and the New Orleans Jazz and Heritage Foundation for their generous support.</p><p> </p><p>Students, teachers, researchers, and others are encouraged to contact the Center about this digital collection and related materials.

p16313coll42	Print Culture of the Civil Rights Movement, 1950-1980	<p>The Civil Rights Movement in the United States coincided with rapid changes in a variety of news and communications media. The expansion of television and documentary filmmaking brought images of the struggles of African Americans and those who supported civil rights into the homes of the American populace. However, control of the tone and content of electronic media was not always in the hands of those who were being documented. It was the democratization of various printed media that allowed civil rights leaders, workers, and organizations to circulate their combined, and sometimes contradictory, voices.</p><p> </p><p>This digital collection is an expansion of the exhibition The Revolution Will Not Be...: Print Culture of the Civil Rights Movement held at the Amistad Research Center in 2011. As the nation’s oldest, largest, and arguably most comprehensive independent archives/library documenting the modern Civil Rights Movement, the Amistad Research Center has brought together relevant documents from a variety of archival collections, including the papers of activists such as John O’Neal Papers, Fannie Lou Hamer Papers, Clarie Collins Harvey, Connie Harse, John Lee Tilley, as well as the Eric Steele Wells collection, the Center’s own ephemera collection, and other sources. This project highlights the newspapers, posters, broadsides, pamphlets, fliers, and other printed ephemera produced by student and community groups, leading civil rights organizations, and individuals, which documented a revolutionary era.</p><p> </p><p>Students, teachers, researchers, and others are encouraged to contact the Center about this digital collection and related materials on the Civil Rights Movement held at Amistad.

The manuscript consists of 230 pages including an index of the names of the approximately 1200 people who came before the Comite Medicale petitioning for the right to practice medicine in Louisiana. As such, it is of interest to genealogists as well as medical historians. Even though it has an index it is somewhat cumbersome to use as the text of the document is handwritten in French. The names in the index are also handwritten and the user must search through all names that begin with a certain letter to locate names, as the names are not in alphabetical order. In order to find a specific entry, it is necessary to identify the proper page number from the personal name index, go to the page number index, display the page and read/print the appropriate entry.</p><p>A Review of Licensing Provisions in Louisiana, and the Significance of the Registre du Comite Medical de la Nouvelle Orleans. Postell, William D., Sr. Typescript. Tulane Medical Library History Collection. No date. </p><p> Louisiana has consistently exercised more control over the practice of medicine than the Eastern seaboard states. During the Colonial period there were laws regulating the practice of medicine which were far in advance of their times. Between 1803 to 1812 the Territorial legislature enacted laws governing the practice of medicine and pharmacy, and these laws were surprisingly progressive. In 1816-17 the State revised the medical legislation establishing two medical licensing boards, one for the Eastern and Western districts of the State. Until 1852 these laws with some modification remained in effect. The 1816 measure provided both fines and imprisonment for anyone practicing medicine without a license. This law provided some check on the rise of quackery.</p><p> The 1816 law established a medical licensing board consisting of four physicians and one apothecary in New Orleans. Its first activity was to record it activities faithfully for 36 years of its existence. It also acted as a State Board of Health. This record was known as the Registre du Comite Medical de la Nouvelle Orleans, and this record is held in the Rudolph Matas Library of Tulane University. </p><p>In 1817 a second examining board was established known as the Western district. It was designated to hold meetings in Opelousas and Alexandria. The Eastern district was renamed, and its membership increased to six. In 1820 a law was enacted by declaring anyone with a regular medical degree could obtain a license without examination. The Western district was less effective, but the results of their meeting were recorded in the Notarial records at the Parish Court House where it met. </p>

She was primarily self-educated with only a few months of formal schooling at a nearby convent. De la Houssaye began a school in the Franklin area and also worked as the postmistress. She wrote stories and poetry for her eight grandchildren whom she raised after her daughter died young.  De la Houssaye wrote short stories and novelettes set primarily in St. Mary and St. Martin parishes, areas between Lafayette and New Orleans, about plantation life, manners of the Creoles and their attitudes toward Acadians and Americans. The stories are of interest for their rendition of Cajun and Negro French dialects. The story plots are simple, designed to appeal to plantation women and convent educated girls. She also wrote morality tales for the education and character training of her eight grandchildren. She wrote in French only to encourage her grandchildren to maintain the dialect and be cognizant of their Creole heritage.  De la Houssaye sold at least three of her stories to the popular American author and New Orleans native George Washington Cable for his book, Strange True Stories of Louisiana. Letters from de la Houssaye to Cable during their six year correspondence are available in the George Washington Cable Papers at Tulane University.  Although not widely celebrated during her lifetime, Sidonie de la Houssaye was later recognized as a Louisiana French writer of distinction in Les Ecrits de Langue Francaise en Louisiana au XIX Siècle. Her works have been the subject of two dissertations completed at LSU, "A Critical Study of the Life and Writings of Sidonie de la Houssaye with Special Emphasis on the Unpublished Works (1966)" by Joseph John Perret and "Liminality in Gender, Race, and Nation in Les Quarteronnes de la Nouvelle-Orléans by Sidonie de la Houssaye (2006)" by Christine Koch Harris. </p><p>FINDING AID</p><p> LSU Libraries Special Collections</p>

p16313coll46	Social Framework - Photographs by Marion Palfi, 1945-1960	<p>Social Framework: Photographs by Marion Palfi, 1945-1960, is a collection of photographs taken by Marion Palfi, a member of the New York Photo League. This collection captures a diverse spectrum of the American population and daily life from the end of the Second World War to 1960. Palfi often chose to go where other photographers either did not go, or where they could not gain access. In so doing, Palfi used her camera to study society and document people who were often "forgotten" by mainstream society, but never-the-less constituted part of the American social fabric. Therefore, aspects of social and economic life from the mid-1940s to the 1960s that were not presented in textbooks or other media during that period, are represented in the photos. For example, the collection features African American servicemen in uniform, as well as photographs of African Americans working in a wartime factory plant. </p><p>The economic disparity in the lives of the working class is evident in images of people waiting in line for jobs at an employment office, and in images of dilapidated housing in poor neighborhoods. The daily lives of southern African Americans is captured in photos of farming, church schools, laborers, and country scenes. Evidence of the racial discrimination African Americans endured at the hands of Jim Crow are imprinted on photographs of "Whites Only" segregation signs appearing on storefronts. In addition to Southern scenes, New York's Harlem neighborhood is also displayed prominently. Photographs of Harlem buildings and residents, as well as of building entrances, including the now defunct Sydenham Hospital, were immortalized by Palfi's lens.</p>
p16313coll66	Sounding Translation	<p>Sounding Translation is an Internet-accessible interview series that publicly archives translators’ reflections on the experience of translating contemporary poetry through audio interviews with the producer and host, Teresa Villa-Ignacio. It is an ongoing digitized oral history project that traces the development of relationships of exchange and collaboration among American poet-translators and their international peers working in languages including Arabic French, German, Spanish, Italian, and Portuguese. As such, it complements Teresa Villa-Ignacio’s book manuscript-in-progress: Poethical Import: Translationships in Contemporary French-American Poetic Exchange. Sounding Translation raises awareness about the role of translators in the dissemination of literature and the importance of translation as a literary endeavor.</p>
p16313coll64	Sounds of Louisiana	<p>Contibute your sounds to this collection! Submit your files and metadata using our form.</p><p> </p><p>New Orleans and the surrounding region offer a plethora of sounds that are culturally, geographically, and architecturally unique to the region. Among many other things, this collection serves as an auditory historical marker of the changing city, for as the city-scape changes, so do the sounds. This collection originates with the work of a group of sound artists actively creating new sound art in New Orleans. The earliest record of the phrase “sound art” dates from 1983 with William Hellerman’s curated exhibition Sound/Art at New York’s Sculpture Center. Although sound art became more prevalent in the 1990s, this art form has a number of much earlier antecedents. The earliest conceptualizations of noise as music were by the Italian futurist Luigi Russolo, who developed several noise machines between 1913 and 1921 and authored the “Futurist Manifesto” in which he wrote “...we delight much more in combining in our thoughts the noises of trams, of automobile engines, of carriages, and brawling crowds, than in hearing again the “Eroica” or the “Pastorale”(The Art of Noises, p. 25).” </p><p>In 1920, Erik Satie took this concept a step further with two performances of Musique d’ameublement, in which repetitive musical fragments were to be played as a backdrop (as if time repeats itself) while the audience participated in the performance through their movements across the performance space and conversation (thus representing the continuation of time). Perhaps the most commonly known precursor to sound art is musique concrète, developed in 1948 by Pierre Schaeffer. Musique concrète describes a style of composition in which composers re-use portions of existing recordings or make new recordings of sounds from the world around them (e.g. the sound made by a car crossing a specific bridge) and recombine them in a number of variations and alterations to create a new piece of music. Sound art, although still loosely defined, generally combines values and techniques from each of these earlier musical forms. As in musique concrète, existing recordings as well as field recordings of sounds captured in the local environment may be used as primary concepts of the work either in their original form or electronically altered. Similarly, like the work of Satie, sound art also includes some visual component (painting, photographic, film, sculpture, etc.) and the audience’s experience of sound, visual, and space is often considered an intrinsic part of the work. </p><p>The sounds collected here are the field recordings of local sound artists, students, and faculty at Tulane University. While they were collected for possible integration into sound art and musical compositions, the sounds collected here more broadly represent an auditory history of New Orleans and the surrounding region, and may be linked to the streets, buildings, and neighborhoods of New Orleans and the surrounding region of the early 21st century. As such, these sounds have historical, cultural, architectural, and geographic significance. Although some sounds in this collection may be restricted in their use, many will be available for download and re-use under creative commons licenses.</p><p> </p>

Tensas	Tensas River National Wildlife Refuge Ivory Billed Woodpecker Records	<p></p><p>This collection is comprised of 100 photographic prints documenting 6 field seasons during the years 1935-1941 when James T. Tanner and associates studied the ivory-billed woodpecker and its environment on the Singer Tract, Madison Parish, Louisiana, in what is now the Tensas River National Wildlife Refuge. Also included is Tanner's hand-drawn, two-sided map documenting nesting sites and other signs of the ivory-billed woodpecker's presence in the Singer and Ayer Tracts, Madison Parish.In 1935, a team of Cornell scientists - including Arthur A. Allen, Peter Paul Kellogg, George Miksch Sutton, J.J. Kuhn, and James T. Tanner - located three ivory-billed woodpecker nests in the Singer Tract. The researchers spent several days closely monitoring one of the nests and produced the first motion pictures and sound recordings ever obtained of the species. From 1937 to 1941, James Tanner (1914-1991) spent a large portion of his time living in the Singer Tract, collecting information about the ivory-billed woodpecker. Tanner used the data for his Cornell doctoral dissertation, which the Audubon Society later published in the Research report of the National Audubon Society, number 1, 1942. In 1941, Tanner and his wife, Nancy Burnham Sheedy Tanner, saw several ivory-billed woodpeckers at the Singer Tract. That same year, the National Audubon Society launched a campaign to preserve the Singer Tract as a refuge for ivory-billed woodpeckers. Tanner taught at East Tennessee State University from 1940, before serving in the Navy during World War II, reaching the rank of Lieutenant-Commander. From 1947 until retirement in 1979, he was at the University of Tennessee. Tanner did not return to the area until the 1980s, when the Tensas River National Wildlife Refuge officially opened. </p>

Gurney established a daguerreotype studio in Natchez in 1851 and began recording the lives of their fellow citizens using the latest in photographic technology. The Civil War brought economic disaster and social upheaval to the region, but Natchez quickly recovered. In 1870, Henry Gurney hired a new employee, Henry Norman, and by 1876 Norman had opened his own studio, buying out Gurney's studio to do so. Henry Norman became the best-known photographer in the region. When he died in 1913, his son Earl inherited the studio. Earl, like his father, became widely known for his photographic skills and left images spanning nearly 40 years. </p>

Theses submitted from Fall 2011-present are available at http://scholarworks.uno.edu/honors_theses/.</p><p></p><p>The University of New Orleans Honors Program is designed to challenge academically astute students, offer a curriculum that will prepare them for success in their respective fields, and reward those motivated and competitive enough to achieve high academic goals. Besides earning the distinction that accompanies academic success, honors students participate in small, challenging classes taught by select faculty. They also have the opportunity to contract with professors of regular classes to receive honors credit by fulfilling additional academic requirements. The senior honors thesis requirement allows students to immerse themselves in advanced independent study, utilizing the experience and guidance of their thesis adviser.</p><p></p><p> To qualify for membership, first semester freshmen must have a composite ACT score of 26 (with at least a 27 in English), or be invited by the Honors Director. Continuing or transfer students may also qualify with a 3.25 cumulative GPA. Students maintain their Honors status based on academic performance. </p><p></p><p> As students pursue their various degrees, they must satisfactorily complete 30 hours of honors credit.These may be taken as special honors classes (listed in the bulletin), or contracted honors classes ("Honors Options"). The only required Honors classes are these: Arts and Sciences 1119, an exploration of Greek literature and philosophy; and ENGL 1159, which satisfies the English composition requirement, or ENGL 2279, which fulfills a literature requirement. (A&S 1119 counts as a social science or humanities elective, and it must be taken concurrently with either of the Honors English courses.) These courses should be taken in a student's first or second semester. As seniors, Honors students must complete an Honors thesis. This involves registering for six hours of Honors thesis credit, three to be taken in each of the last two semesters. A student will typically choose an adviser and begin research in the next-to-last undergraduate semester and complete the written portion in the last semester under the direction of the chosen adviser and the director of the Honors Program. Successful completion of these requirements allows a student to graduate with University and Departmental Honors. </p><p></p><p> Access to the theses in this collection is "restricted" by the Honors Program.

UNO_SCC	UNO Historical Archives of the Supreme Court of Louisiana	<p>Historical Note</p><p>The Supreme Court of Louisiana holds the distinction of  being the state's highest court, or, as it is often called, the court of  last resort in Louisiana.  By order of the Court on November 4, 1976,  its historical archives-defined as those records created from the  Court's inception in 1813, when Louisiana's first state constitution  became effective, through 1920-were deposited in the Earl K. Long  Library at the University of New Orleans "to ensure their preservation  and safety."</p><p> </p><p>The archives consist mainly of manuscript case files  appealed from lower state courts to the Supreme Court of Louisiana.   Occupying approximately 2,730 linear feet, case files range in extent  from several pages to thousands of pages.  Rules required that the Court  be provided with a complete transcript of lower court files and  evidence; thus the case files include maps, surveys, printed briefs, and  a host of other documentation.  Often these are the only extant copies,  not only of appellate arguments and decisions, but also of records that  originated with lower courts, for many lower-court copies have been  lost to fire, theft, and age-related deterioration.</p><p> </p><p>Case files include a small number of legal documents,  dating between 1769 and 1812, which were used as exhibits or in  transcripts, and dockets for some cases which were "unreported", meaning  that the opinion was not published in Louisiana Reports.  Supplementing  these case files are docket books, which serve as a sort of index to  the case files, and minute books, which summarize particular cases and  record the Court's disposition of them.</p><p> </p><p>In addition to the winter and spring sessions held in New  Orleans, until 1894 the Supreme Court met elsewhere in the state during  the summer and fall, at times in Opelousas, Alexandria, Baton Rouge,  Monroe, Natchitoches, and Shreveport.  Each location maintained its own  docket-numbering system.  Several times, coinciding with new state  constitutions, one numbering system was discontinued and another was  begun.  Many case files, docket books, and minute books for Court  sessions held outside New Orleans are missing.  Since 1898 the Court has  held its sessions only in New Orleans.</p><p> </p><p>Research Tips</p><p> </p><p>One of the easiest ways to locate a relevant case, available  on most campuses, is LexisNexis Academic's Legal Research.  On the main  page of "LexisNexis Academic", click on the "Legal" navigational tab at  the top of the page, then click "Federal & State Cases" on the  navigation links along the right-hand side of the page.  To further  narrow your search, select "LA Federal & State Cases, Combined" from  the drop-down menu next to "Sources", expand "Show options to search  specific document sections", select "Court" from the drop-down menu next  to "Section", and type in "Louisiana High Court".  To ensure that only  the years covered by UNO's holdings are searched, enter "1812" and  "1921" as the date range under "Specify Date".</p><p> </p><p>Researchers should note that not all of the court's opinions  were published.  For example, if the judges applied well-established  principles to a case with no novel facts, they did not bother to publish  the opinion as it had no value as a precedent.  But what is of little  interest to the lawyer might be of great interest to the historian or  anthropologist.  The files of these "unreported" cases are a potential  gold mine, but accessing them can be difficult as there is no published  reference to them, other than the list of "Cases Not Reported" in the  front of the annual legal reports after 1865.  Besides the annual  reports, researchers may consult the docket indexes to the New Orleans  sessions to discover these cases involving individuals, companies or  institutions from that portion of the state.  Thomas C. Manning's  Unreported Cases Heard and Determined by the Supreme Court of Louisiana,  from January 8, 1877, to April, 1880, Digested, Reported, and Condensed  (St. Louis: Nixon-Jones Printing Co., 1884), a copy of which is in the  Dart Collection (Mss 140), is another useful source.</p><p> </p><p>Researchers using the collection to study various  historical and cultural topics should keep in mind that this is a  collection of materials related to law and should familiarize  them-selves with the precise legal vocabulary used by the court.  For  example, historians interested in placage, the antebellum practice of  white men keeping a black mistress, will not find any cases if they  search for "placage" in LexisNexis.  The appropriate legal term is  "concubinage," and a search using that word yields fifty-five cases  where the term occurs before 1865.  An excellent source for checking the  terms you wish to search is any edition of William K. Dart and Edward  F. White's Louisiana Digest Annotated (1917; Second series, 1937; new  1951; the latter is in our Reference Collection KFL 57.L66), which gives  case citations as well as cross-references to other useful terms.   Another good source is West's Louisiana Digest 1809 to Date (Reference  Collection KFL 57 .L66).</p><p> </p><p>Another very useful tool for finding case files that deal  with portions of the state's constitution or legislative acts is  Theodore Roehl's Annotations to the Statute Law of the State of  Louisiana (New Orleans: F. F. Hansell & Bro., Ltd., 1917), a copy of  which is in the Dart Collection (Mss 140).  This breaks down the Civil  Code, Code of Practice, Constitutions (1812-1913), and Acts of the  Legislature (1822-1916) into their articles, sections, and acts, and  lists the legal citations for all Supreme Court cases that deal with  these individual components.</p><p> </p><p>Available Circuits</p><p> </p><p>Circuits have been given an "index" letter to ease searching.

p16313coll58	William Barth Photographs of Mississippi and Atchafalaya River operations	<p></p><p> </p><p>The photographs in the William Barth Papers, 1917-1959 Series I “Engineering and Levee Revetment documents, ca. 1925-1959” contain the subseries “Photographs of levee work, ca. 1928-1945.” The nearly 250 images depict various stages and types of work on the levees of the lower Mississippi River and Louisiana's Atchafalaya Basin. Most of the larger photographs (9.5x6.5 inches) involve revetment of the levees on the Mississippi River from around Natchez down to the New Orleans area. Various revetment types (including those using wood, concrete, and asphalt) appear in this series. Also depicted are the procurement of loess and sand for various construction projects on the river. The smaller photographs show levees in the Atchafalaya Basin being built; many of these include photographs of heavy machinery such as excavation towers, elevating graders, and Caterpillar tractors.</p><p> </p><p>Biographical Note</p><p>William Barth was born in New York City on December 22, 1898 to German immigrants. Barth worked for the Interstate Commerce Commission, traveling from Maine to Florida to survey railroad tracks. In 1928 he took a position with the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers in Natchez, Mississippi. For thirty years he worked on flood control of both the Mississippi and Atchafalaya Rivers and helped with major projects such as the Bonnet Carre Spillway. During World War II he received a commendation for meritorious civilian service since he helped control flood waters that could have damaged crops and held back war production. He died February 17, 1982.</p><p> </p><p>View the collection finding aid.</p>
p15140coll19	William Branks Stewart Collection	<p>William Branks Stewart was a medical artist for Louisiana State University  Medical School - New Orleans from 1933 until his untimely death of a heart attack in 1950. During his time as head of the medical arts department, Mr. Stewart gained national recognition for his work in the field of medical illustration, specifically for his use of an airbrush to produce medical illustrations. A 1946 article from the New Orleans Times-Picayune offers this description: </p><p> </p><p>For 13 years Mr. Stewart has been recording in picture form the details of surgical operations, disease processes and bone fractures for the local medical school. These illustrative art works are used for museum demonstrations, in textbooks, in medical journals and as teaching aids for class work of medical students.  Mr. Stewart not only paints but also draws and makes plaster molds. He takes photographs through microscopes and down such complicated devices as the bronchoscope-which is used to see inside a person's windpipe, bronchial tubes and lungs. When a surgeon suddenly finds something at an operation which he wishes to record or publish, a rush call is made for drawings or photographs. Sometimes a patient presents a rare condition at one of the clinics and Mr. Stewart is called over immediately. Some weeks he attends as many as five operations. Requests for him are frequently made by surgeons with new techniques that they want recorded. At the medical school, Mr. Stewart has four rooms full of mysterious gadgets which, to the uninitiated eye of the layman, appear like a series of Rube Goldberg contraptions.</p><p> </p><p>A native of Airdrie, Scotland, Mr. Stewart studied art at Glasgow School of Art before moving to America in 1925 to take a job at Northwestern  University dental school. In 1933 he moved to New Orleans to work for LSU Medical  School. In addition, he painted landscapes as a hobby. A member of the New Orleans Art league, his portraits and landscapes were exhibited in the Art League's annual exhibit, and in 1941 he presented a one-man show at the Delgado Museum (now the New Orleans Museum of Art). Mr. Stewart was a fixture during the early years of LSU Medical School, regularly providing illustrations for The Tiger, the school's student newspaper. A 1934 interview with a Tiger reporter reveals his sense of humor: </p><p></p><p>Why did I study art? To make big money? Am I making it? To dodge work? Am I dodging it? Have I failed? No, I am doing something I enjoy, among people I enjoy, and in what I consider to be the most interesting city in America. So what the h---. </p><p></p><p>Mr. Stewart's collection of airbrushed and pen and ink medical art was found in the LSU Health Sciences Center Archives during renovations in 2009, and is now available in digital format for public view.</p><p> </p><p>Visitors with more information about Mr. William Branks Stewart or any of these images are encouraged to contact digitalarchives@lsuhsc.edu, so we may further add to the collection.</p>
p15140coll54	William J. Thornton Music Collection	<p></p><p>This collection consists of nearly 60 digital recordings of music composed by William James Thornton Jr. Approximately 30 recordings also have corresponding printable digitized scores available in PDF form.</p><p>William James Thornton Jr. (1919-1996) earned a bachelor’s degree (1941) and master of music degree (1948) from Louisiana State University. From 1942-1946 Thornton served in the United States Air Force Special Services, touring the South Pacific as music director and composing over 180 compositions and musicals. The script of Gen. Clerk of the U.S. Army (c.1945) is the only manuscript to have survived from this period, according to a handwritten note in the collection that details that he burned most of them because of his desire to be considered a ‘serious’ composer.</p><p>After his PhD from the University of Southern California, Thornton held many appointments as a music educator before landing at Trinity University in San Antonio, Texas, where he spent the majority of his professional career. In 1980, he earned the prestigious title of Professor Emeritus at Trinity University and after his retirement in 1988, he accepted a lecturer position in music composition at the University of Texas at San Antonio.</p><p>Thornton was a prolific composer and created works for a wide range of mediums including film, musicals, and one electronic piece title ‘Water Tower Music’ for Electro-Magnetic Tape (1984). He has received numerous awards including first prize in the 1945 National Federation of Music Clubs Young Composers Contest for his Sonatina for Violin and Piano (1944), the Performance Award of the Symposium of Western Composers, and the Carolyn Alchin Award to study composition with Pulitzer Prize-winner Roger Sessions.</p><p>The William J. Thornton Papers (1939-1998) consist primarily of manuscripts, acetate record discs, and cassette and reel-to-reel audio and video tape recordings. Recordings and a selection of corresponding scores have been digitized and are available as the William J. Thornton Music Collection in this Louisiana Digital Library collection.</p>

A few highlights from the Baton Rouge area include a map of old and new street names (1929), an 1809 map of what is now downtown Baton Rouge,  an 1806 broadside advertising lots for sale in Beauregard Town, and a map of the State Penitentiary grounds when it was located in the capital city.  The collection offers opportunities for research into map making and drafting, land tenure and settlement, local history, architecture, engineering, horticulture, and genealogy. </p><p>The work of surveyors and civil engineers William G. Waller (1813-1891) and his brother Henry Waller (1808-1854) comprise a large portion of the collection.  Natives of New York and Maryland, respectively, by at least 1847 they had settled in Baton Rouge, eventually becoming surveyors for East Baton Rouge Parish.  Additional surveyors, cartographers, and draftsmen also represented in the collection are Robert A. Hart, John H. Mundinger, Reiner Swart, among others.</p><p></p><p>Large-format materials included here are drawn from the larger William Waller Survey Collection, Mss. 3592, 3910, 4326. </p><p> </p>
