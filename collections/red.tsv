p15140coll30	Aleman Estate (Hathaway Gibbens) Collection	<p>Government-issued postcards first appeared in Austria in 1869 as an economical means of transmitting a message. They swiftly spread throughout Europe and were adopted in the United States in 1873. Meanwhile, pictorial postcards were introduced in France in 1870. Pictorials did not, however, enjoy immediate popularity in the United States, where such privately printed cards required two cents' postage; government postcards cost only a penny. As of July 1, 1898, the Private Mailing Card Act eliminated this inequity, and privately published postcards appeared in increasing number. Postcards published before that date, whether mailed are not, are known as "pioneers".</p><p>The World's Colombian Exposition, held in Chicago in 1893, led to the emergence of the modern postcard. Charles Goldsmith, a Chicago entrepreneur, obtained from the U.S. Post Office a license to print souvenir views of the fair on government-issued postals. When test sales of four cards met with success, Goldsmith issued sets of ten illustrations packaged in a wrapper. The cards became available in 1892, in time for the exposition's ground-breaking ceremony.</p><p>After the decrease in postage rates in 1893 gave new impetus to the practice of mailing postcards, collecting them became one of the world's most popular hobbies. At first, the Post Office required that one side of the card be given over in its entirety to the recipient's address; any message had to appear on the front with the illustration, necessitating brevity. New regulations issued in 1907 permitted publishers to divide the reverse of the card to accommodate both message and address in a format which remains in use today.The period between 1898 and the outbreak of World War I was the golden age of postcards. Printers in Austria and Germany, where color reproduction was less costly than elsewhere, produced lovely postcards for American publishers. During the fiscal year ending on June 30, 1908, for example, 677,777,798 postcards were mailed in the United States. In addition, vast, uncounted quantities languished, unsent, in collectors' albums. At the time, the population of the United States was 88,700,000.</p><p>Interest in collecting postcards, after reaching the proportion of a national mania for nearly two decades, diminished abruptly in 1914 because of the onset of World War I and the popularity of newfangled folded greeting cards. As a result, postals dating from the 1920s through the 1960s are more scarce than older specimens. Early collectors called their hobby "cartephilia" or "philocarty", Greek for "a hopeless love of cards". A new wave of postcard collecting commenced in the 1970s, indulged in by a visually literate public which discovered them to be attractive souvenirs of travel and leisure activities, compact to store, and convenient for brief messages. To this generation of collectors their avocation is "deltiology", derived from Greek words meaning "small picture" and "knowledge".</p><p>During the golden age of postcard-collecting, one of the collectors was young Anne Hathaway Gibbens, known familiarly as Hathy. As a student of the Ursuline nuns in New Orleans between ca. 1906 and 1910, Hathaway was sent postcards by her mother and other relatives. Hathaway also received postcards, chiefly from friends, at various Gibbens family residences in New Orleans, Louisiana and in Ocean Springs and Bay St. Louis, Mississippi. She arranged the cards in albums, supplementing her own acquisitions with a small quantity of postcards addressed to her sister Gladys and to Will J. Gibbens, who presumably was her brother.</p><p>Represented most prominently in Hathaway Gibbens' collection are viewcards, those which depict a building or scene; there are just a few subject cards and no advertising postcards. The largest two series in the collection contain Louisiana and Mississippi scenes. Such postcards became available in the late 1890s. Some provide the earliest color images of small-town and rural sites and structures or the only surviving illustration of a building or an event.</p><p>Browse postcards by series:</p>

p16313coll34	Armand Duplantier Family Letters, LSU Libraries	<p></p><p>View all items in collection.</p><p> </p><p>The Armand Duplantier Family Letters date from 1777 to 1841 and contain items from four generations of the Duplantier family, including Armand Duplantier, his uncle Claude Trénonay,  Armand’s son Armand Allard Duplantier, and granddaughter Amélie Augustine Duplantier Peniston.  The collection’s historical significance lies not only in what it can tell us about the history of Baton Rouge and nearby Pointe Coupée Parish, but also in what it reveals about the state’s colonial period, Francophone Louisiana in the territorial and antebellum era, and the enduring legacy of the state’s French antecedents.</p><p> </p><p>In particular, the letters relate to Louisiana under the French, Spanish, and Americans and the economic, political, and social conditions attendant on transitioning among the three powers; commerce with France; the succession of Trénonay; attitudes about the French Revolution; slavery and plantation matters; family news such as illness, births, deaths, and the education of Duplantier’s children; and travels in France by Amélie Duplantier.</p><p> </p><p>Armand Duplantier, Sr., whose letters represent the bulk of the collection, was born in Voiron, France, in 1753. He served as aide-de-camp to the Marquis de Lafayette during the American Revolution and came to Louisiana in 1781 to assist his uncle, Claude Trénonay, in running his plantation in Pointe Coupée Parish.  Soon after his arrival, he married Trénonay’s step-daughter, Augustine.   He continued to manage his uncle’s interests, purchased and sold additional slaves and land in Pointe Coupée, the Felicianas, and the Baton Rouge area, and raised cotton, indigo, and tobacco.  He also developed land holdings in New Orleans, where he lived for a time.  Soon after his wife’s death of yellow fever, in 1802 Duplantier married Constance Rochon Joyce, the widow of John Joyce, the original owner of Magnolia Mound Plantation near Baton Rouge.  Failed crops and poor investments led him to declare bankruptcy in 1814.</p><p> </p><p>In addition to his planting activities, Duplantier was somewhat involved in public life.  His friendship with Lafayette had continued after the Revolution, and when Lafayette was granted lands in Louisiana in 1803 in recognition of his service during the American Revolution, Duplantier was charged with acquiring them.  He was also part of the delegation that welcomed Lafayette during his 1825 visit to Louisiana.   Always concerned about suitable educational opportunities for his own children, he helped establish Baton Rouge College in 1822.  He died five years later and was buried in Highland Cemetery with military honors.</p><p> </p><p>The Armand Duplantier Family Letters were given by the descendants of Guy Antoine Allard Duplantier, elder brother of Armand Duplantier, to their Louisiana cousins, and subsequently donated to the LSU Libraries in 2011.</p><p> </p><p>Transcriptions and translations for this project were prepared by David Laatsch (MLS, LSU 2012), under the supervision and editorship of Special Collections Library Associate in Public Services Germain Bienvenu, PhD.

p16313coll73	Black Natchez	<p>Filmmaker Ed Pincus worked and taught in the 1960s and 70s to develop a direct cinema approach to social and political problems. In 1965, Pincus spent ten weeks in Natchez, Mississippi, filming the lives of ordinary people in the Civil Rights Movement from which he developed two seminal black and white 16mm documentaries. His first film, Black Natchez, telecast on NET Journal, charts early attempts to organize and register Black voters and the formation of a self defense group in the Black community.</p><p>Black Natchez (1967, 62 min.) was shot the week following the murder of Wharlest Jackson, the treasurer of the Natchez branch of the NAACP. Jackson had been working in the Armstrong Tire and Rubber Plant, and had recently been promoted to a position that had been previously held by white workers. On the evening of February 27, 1965, a bomb detonated in Jackson’s pickup truck and killed him. He had received threats at the plant, and the incident highlighted the continued presence of the Ku Klux Klan in Natchez. In the week that followed, the African American community, along with local and national civil rights activists, gathered to address the problem. What Pincus captured were the protest marches, community meetings, and general public sentiment following Jackson’s death. The rolls of film he shot are genuine, often candid, portrayals of a community in a time of turmoil. At times, Pincus and his partner, David Neuman, turn the camera on an individual and interview him. Interviewees range from prominent civil rights leaders, including Charles Evers, to more representative residents, and they are asked to express his or her thoughts and feelings about racial tensions and violence in the city. The film also chronicles the tensions between the NAACP and the Mississippi Freedom Democratic Party, both of which were operating in Natchez.</p>
p16313coll39	Bourbon Street, 1944-1952	<p>The Southeastern Architectural Archive, Tulane University Libraries, is home to the Walter Cook Keenan New Orleans Photographs Collection numbering over 3,000 images. Walter Cook Keenan (1881-1970), the first architect of the Vieux Carré Commission (VCC) and a lifelong member of the Audubon Park Commission, took the photographs in order to document changes to the built environment. In 2013, the Tulane Digital Library undertook to digitize the portion of the collection focused on historic Bourbon Street. </p><p>Bourbon Street underwent significant changes during the mid-twentieth century. Beginning in 1944, the VCC increasingly sought to regulate the appearance of building facades, especially by limiting signage and prohibiting the use of neon. As VCC architect, Keenan conducted daily property inspections to document Vieux Carré Ordinance violations. Entertainment businesses along Bourbon Street were notably affected by the ordinance and Keenan recorded nearly every property along the artery more than once. Bourbon Street's night clubs, jazz musicians, burlesque shows, restaurants and boarding houses became his photographic subjects. The collection includes images of Sloppy Joe's, Lenny Gale's Sugar Bowl, the Old Barn Bar, Zonia's Cocktail Lounge, Ciro's, the Magic Lock, the Famous Door, 418 Bar, Dixie's Bar of Music, and Stormy's Casino Royale. Signs for burlesque dancers Evangeline, Bubbles, Kalantan, Pam Holloway, and Stormy's Mother also feature prominently.</p>

p15140coll25	Charity Hospital Reports	<p> The history of Charity Hospital in New Orleans, Louisiana begins on May  10, 1736.  On that date, the first Charity Hospital,  funded by the estate of shipbuilder Jean Louis, opened in a house on  Chartres and Bienville Streets in the historic French Quarter  to serve the city's poor and indigent population.  Since that time,  Charity Hospital has moved from location to location around  the city due to fire, flood, and politics.  Charity Hospital's last  location, the 1939 Art-Deco style complex located on Tulane Avenue  in New Orleans, Louisiana, has remained unused since Hurricane Katrina  in August of 2005. </p><p></p><p> The responsibility of Charity Hospital was assumed by the State of  Louisiana on March 17, 1813, almost one year after Louisiana was granted   statehood in 1812. Charity Hospital produced regular reports for the  state government of Louisiana titled Report(s) of the Board of  Administrators of the Charity Hospital to the General Assembly of Louisiana, also known as the Charity Hospital Reports.    Published from 1842 to 1974, these reports are vital to Louisiana's  social and medical history and include information not widely available  from the nineteenth century. The Charity Hospital Reports include  public health information on morbidity and mortality (including  information on the yellow fever epidemics in New Orleans), venereal  disease issues, disease incidence, vital statistics, and hospital  administration.  The reports also have information on the governance and financing of the  hospital. Medical milestones and memorials are sometimes included.  The reported information varies from year to year, but generally there  is a report to the legislature with a statistical report of the diseases   treated in the hospital.   Names of administrators, physicians,  surgeons, residents, internes and donors to the hospital are included in  most reports.  Most of the Charity Hospital Reports were published in English, but some early reports were also published in French.  The 1853 and 1856 Reports are the only years scanned in the French version). The Charity Hospital Reports Collection is a valuable  historic tool for researchers with a wide range of interests from  medical history to the importance of Charity Hospital as both a social  and cultural  institution in the New Orleans area.  All of the reports were published  as documents of the State of Louisiana and therefore are in the public  domain. </p><p></p><p> The John P. Isché Library at Louisiana State University Health Sciences  Center in New Orleans supplemented the Rudolph Matas Library content by  providing replacement copies for scanning as needed to replace damaged  or missing content. The documents are available as .pdf documents with  the  text fully searchable.  Every attempt has been made to make these  documents accessible according to guidelines and standards for Section  508. </p><p></p><p> The Charity Hospital Reports have been digitized by the Rudolph Matas Library of the Health Sciences of Tulane University under a NLM grant  awarded August 2010-June 2011 for a project titled: Early Medical Journalism of Louisiana, A pilot project for the preservation and sharing of  Nineteenth Century Medical Publications of Louisiana [National Library of Medicine (NLM) Prime Contract No. N01-LM-6-3505; HHSN276200663505C]. </p><p></p><p> See also the Matas Library website: Tulane and Charity Hospital: http://matas.tulane.edu/about/tulaneandcharity </p><p></p><p> For more information on the history of Charity Hospital: </p><p></p><p> Matas, Rudolph, and John Duffy.

Booth Collection (MSS 292) at the Earl K. Long Library at the University of New Orelans. Only photos from "Series III Visual Materials, Subseries III.1 Photographs of trucks" are included. Due to potential copyright restrictions, these scans must be viewed on campus.</p><p> </p><p>HISTORICAL NOTE</p><p> </p><p>The first organized Mardi Gras truck parade in New Orleans followed Rex down Canal Street on March 5, 1935, when fifty-six different groups riding on decorated trucks banded together to form the Elks Krewe of Orleanians.  Many of the participants were members of fraternities, sororities, neighborhood social clubs, and schools.  In addition to the Elks trucks, numerous other decorated trucks were sponsored by independent carnival clubs, for a total of nearly one hundred vehicles in the first truck parade. In New Orleans, street celebrations have commemorated Mardi Gras at least since February 24, 1857, when the Mistick Krewe of Comus held its inaugural parade.  The routes of the major parades included St. Charles Avenue, Canal Street, Royal Street, and other principal streets in downtown New Orleans and the French Quarter.  After World War I, some maskers, who had theretofore celebrated as they walked and danced through the streets, formed groups to ride on home-decorated trucks of various description.  The parade routes were heavily policed, however, and the trucks were not permitted to parade on major streets.  As time passed, the number of trucks and the quality of their decoration increased, and something of a competition burgeoned among the truck groups.  By the late 1920s and early 1930s, decorations were becoming increasingly elaborate. After riding on a decorated truck sponsored by the local Lodge #30 of the Benevolent and Protective Order of Elks in 1933, Chris R. Valley conceived the idea of organizing the independent trucks into a parade which would follow Rex on the established parade route.  On September 6, 1934, an Elks Carnival Committee was formed within the lodge, with Valley as its chairman.  On January 18, 1935, the group began publicizing the plan in the newspaper.  Given impetus by local columnists such as Mel Washburn and F. Edward Hebert, by the Elks committee, and by the general enthusiasm for Carnival, the idea caught on, and the Elks Krewe of Orleanians was born.  Valley, who remained active with the group for thirty years, gathered many of the materials in the collection. As time passed, the Elks Krewe of Orleanians grew, generally sponsoring forty-five to one hundred trucks annually from 1935 to 1955, one hundred fifty trucks through 1965, one hundred eighty trucks through 1971, and one hundred fifty trucks since 1971.  In 1946, Russell Calonge formed the Krewe of Crescent City, a parade of fifty to seventy-five trucks which follows the Elks Krewe of Orleanians.  Two additional truck parades began in the mid-1970s to follow the Krewe of Argus parade in Metairie, Louisiana (Jefferson Parish): the Krewe of Jefferson, founded by William H. Aitken, and the Elks Krewe of Jeffersonians, sponsored by B.P.O.E. Lodge #30.  Together they contribute some one hundred trucks, and the Elks Krewe of Gretna on the West Bank provides about sixty-five more.  Another dozen or so trucks follow the Krewe of St. Bernard parade in St. Bernard Parish.  Each truck is sponsored by an individual carnival club consisting of ten to fifteen families.  On average, forty persons ride on each truck. Maskers riding on trucks are known for the generosity with which they toss favors, known as “throws,” into the crowds of spectators.  This custom began during the earliest Mardi Gras celebrations with the throwing of foodstuffs, candies, and cookies, and evolved into today’s assortment of beads, plastic toys and cups, and doubloons.  The last of these, a 1½”, lightweight aluminum medallion, was originated by H. Alvin Sharpe.  First used by Rex in 1960, doubloons had spread by 1963 to the truck parades.  The first truck doubloon was a ceramic disc distributed by the Verbenas Carnival Club, followed in 1964 by a wooden nickel thrown by the Trabs Carnival Club.  Beginning in 1965, truck doubloons proliferated so rapidly that by 1969, some one hundred seventeen trucks out of a total of two hundred seventy in Greater New Orleans were throwing their own truck doubloons.  By 1969, however, interest in truck doubloons was diminishing.  During their glory years, however, some two hundred twenty carnival clubs were responsible for the minting of three thousand different medallions, for a total of more than twenty-five million truck doubloons. The collection was donated to the Earl K.

LSU_CNP	Chickamauga and Chattanooga National Military Park Photographs	<p></p><p> </p><p>The Chickamauga and Chattanooga National Military Park was the first and largest military park in the United States. The park was officially dedicated in September 1895. The Louisiana Commission (or Committee) created the images in the Chickamauga-Chattanooga National Military Park collection after the Louisiana and National Commissioners established the official points of interest. The Park contains approximately 8,190 acres of land divided among several areas in Tennessee and Georgia. The collection contains twenty-nine (29) albumen photoprints of the grounds of the Park, taken circa 1894. There are eight (8) photographs from Missionary Ridge (Tenn. and Ga.) and twenty-one (21) photographs from Chickamauga (Ga.). The physical collection can be viewed at Louisiana State University's Hill Memorial Library.</p>
p15140coll10	Civil War Context and Conflict at LSU Libraries	<p></p><p> </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>On April 12, 1861, the first shots rang from Fort Sumter, sparking what would become the most devastating conflict ever fought in North America. The American Civil War (1861-1865) played out in over 10,000 settings across the American landscape, taking the lives of more than 600,000 soldiers. The war was a watershed moment in the nation’s history, ushering in a new economic, social and political order, leaving behind slavery and a planter aristocracy in the South, and ensuring that American democracy and free labor would survive both in the East and in the new states of the West. </p><p> </p><p> The Louisiana State University Libraries’ Division of Special Collections, housed in Hill Memorial Library, offers researchers a rich collection of materials relating to the antebellum, Civil War, and Reconstruction periods. The majority of these sources are part of the Louisiana and Lower Mississippi Valley Collections (LLMVC), which boast extensive holdings of books, periodicals, maps, manuscripts, state documents, and microfilm that support scholarly research in many areas, including religion, plantation management, slavery, French Creole identity and relations, and Southern nationalism. </p><p> </p><p> In conjunction with the Association of Southeastern Research Libraries (ASERL)-sponsored collaborative digital project, "Civil War in the American South" marking the sesquicentennial of the Civil War, LSU’s Special Collections staff has digitized 150 items from the LLMVC and Rare Book Collections. The materials chosen were included as illustrations of the ideological, political, and cultural origins of the Civil War. With historical themes ranging from Southern culture and a developing sectional identity, race relations, and gender to plantation life and politics in the years 1850-1865, the digital collection provides context for secession and the war itself. </p><p> Both published and unpublished materials were selected.</p><p> </p><p> View All Unpublished Items: </p><p> Unpublished manuscript items relate to education in the South, particularly the early history of the Louisiana State Seminary of Learning (present day Louisiana State University) immediately before and during the early years of the Civil War; racial attitudes, slavery, plantation management, and the transition from slavery to free labor; family, social life and customs; literature and reading, especially the need for southern-produced works; developing southern nationalism; religion in daily life; and men and women’s attitudes toward secession, politics, and the war. Additional materials include the diary kept by C.S.A. soldier John E. Ellis while a prisoner of war, selected letters of Eugène Dumez regarding Confederate diplomacy in France, and a series of letters from publisher and promoter of Southern commerce J.D.B. De Bow to Louisiana author and politician Charles Gayarré that focus on party politics, the Confederacy, and slavery.</p><p></p><p> Published Items:  </p><p> These sources are strong in topics relating to education, science and the arts in antebellum Louisiana. The diverse group of materials also includes rare sheet music relating to the Civil War and Louisiana. French-language poetry reflecting the state’s French and Creole roots is also available.</p>

Since the first Gulf South Field Survey in 2011, fellows and staff of the Classical Institute of the South (CIS) have cataloged over 1,000 objects in private collections dating from the 18th century through the Civil War. The survey spans Alabama, Louisiana, and Mississippi, and we are continually expanding our reach throughout the region. </p><p> </p><p>So far, the Gulf South Field Study has only scratched the surface of the rich cultural material that survives in the region. In addition to expanding into new physical areas, the CIS also seeks to explore new material evidence of the cultural diversity represented in the Gulf South. As cataloging efforts continue, new information and images will be added to this database in order to draw attention to the objects and to the research possibilities that they present. </p><p> </p><p>Such an undertaking would not be possible without the cooperation of willing homeowners and institutional partners. The CIS is pleased to participate in the active cultural community of the Gulf South region along with collaborators such as The Historic New Orleans Collection, the Louisiana State Museum in New Orleans, Louisiana, the New Orleans Museum of Art, the LSU Museum of Art in Baton Rouge, Louisiana, the Historic Natchez Foundation in Natchez, Mississippi, and others.  </p><p> </p><p>The Historic New Orleans Collection has provided advisory and technical support throughout the project, and hosts the database as part of its contributions to the Louisiana Digital Library.</p><p> </p><p>Visit the Classical Institute of the South's website for news on the progress of the project, highlighted objects, and information on how to get involved. </p><p> </p><p>Browse all items in the collection</p>

Tate (1894-1963), a 1917 graduate of West Point and a field artillery officer who served in both World Wars, was commanding officer of the Louisiana military district in 1950.  A photograph album that belonged to him comprises this digital collection.</p><p>  </p><p>The album, now unbound, contains 103 black and white prints mounted on paper.  The images show scenes from several locations in Louisiana during the 1920s, including Baton Rouge, New Orleans, St. Martinville, Morgan City, Avery Island, and Franklin.  The New Orleans images show scenes of Mardi Gras, The Vieux Carré, buildings, and architectural details.  There are also photos of Bayous scenes, particularly Bayou Teche.  Children and wildlife appear in some of the photos.  In addition, there is a group of logging industry images showing workers, roads, and equipment.  Another group of photos was taken along Louisiana coastal areas and depicts oyster and shrimp fishermen, their boats, nets, camps, activities, and families.</p><p> </p><p>View Collection Finding Aid</p><p> </p>
p16313coll53	Cole Coleman Photographs	<p>The collection consists of gelatin silver prints made by New Orleans photographer Howard “Cole” Coleman (1883-1969) and donated to Tulane University in memory of his wife, Thelma Hecht Coleman. Most images represent Coleman’s professional work in Louisiana; a smaller number consists of copy-stand images taken from historic documents. Most predate his wife’s death in August 1963. </p><p>As a commercial photographer, Coleman specialized in local subjects developed in series. His photographs have a documentary quality since his darkroom work relied primarily on enlargements and cropping. The collection thus includes straight photographs and corresponding negatives of visiting celebrities, jazz musicians, notable structures, festival culture, restaurants, wildlife and foreign trade operations.</p><p>By the late 1950s and influenced by his wife, Coleman focused on the region’s historic architecture, especially rural plantations and Vieux Carré buildings. He took an interest in documenting the same subjects over the course of time, photographing buildings before and after renovations or other significant changes. He used the same approach with his commercial Mardi Gras images, situating his camera in two locations along major parade routes to systematically photograph passing float processions. Gallier Hall (545 St. Charles Street) and the Keller-Zander building (814 Canal Street) typically form the backdrop to his these images.</p><p>Notable amongst his non-architectural series are time-based and aerial photographs. Two separate series of negative images record the sequences of activities associated with Algiers “poor boy” bread-making and Bayou Barataria shrimping. Two series of aerial photographs document trade operations along the Mississippi River, one centered on the Industrial Canal at North Claiborne Avenue and the other on the International Foreign Trade Zone. Wharf productivity is emphasized, with steamers, tugboats, stevedores and exports featuring prominently.</p><p>A smaller group of images document celebrities in New Orleans. He photographed First Lady Eleanor Roosevelt, President Dwight D. Eisenhower, and military aviators Eddie Rickenbacker and Claire Lee Chennault. He recorded Nelson Eddy and Jeannette MacDonald’s appearances at a New Orleans Muscular Dystrophy benefit and Dorothy Lamour’s 1956 Mardi Gras participation. His images of Denise Darcel (1924-2011) clowning with floats in the Rex den coincided with a period in which the French-American actress was regularly performing in New Orleans theatres and night clubs. The Famous Door, the Paddock Lounge, and Alphonse Picou’s St. Claude Avenue funeral drew his attention to local musicians, although this was not a mainstay of his professional work.</p>

p16313coll63	The Crescent City Pictorial	<p>In 1926, former school teacher and newspaper publisher O.C.W. (Orlando Capitola Ward) Taylor published a 28-page souvenir booklet dedicated "to the Progress of the Colored Citizens of New Orleans, Louisiana, "America's Most Interesting City." The Crescent City Pictorial was designed by O.T. Griffin and featured the photography of Villard Paddio. This largely visual publication featured images of African American homes, businesses, schools, churches, and social organizations, and serves as one of the best visual documents of African American life in early 20th century New Orleans.</p><p> </p><p>Businesses include the United Industrial Life Insurance Company, Carr & Llopis Undertakers, Dorsey's Valeteria, Flint-Goodridge Hospital, Geddes & Moss Undertaking and Embalming, George D.

LSU_DYP	Donn Young Photographs	<p></p><p> </p><p>Donn Young began his professional photographer's life over 30 years ago. His work has appeared in Time, Newsweek, the New York Times, and many other publications. In addition to his studio and commercial work, he became the official photographer of the Port of New Orleans in 1996.Donn's entire life's work was in his Lakeview studio and home when the flood waters of Hurricane Katrina rose in 2005. Unreachable for weeks, his home and studio were submerged, drained, and submerged again, with the collection left to mold and ruin in a witches' brew of brackish water, sewage, petroleum products, and other compounds while efforts to drain the city got underway.The LSU Libraries Special Collections managed to salvage 32,645 images portraying a wide range of images from New Orleans, Louisiana, and beyond. Images include people, art, music, theater, plants, food, buildings, views, manners and customs, religion and culture, education, medicine, business, industry and transportation, Associations and Institutions, Publications, sports, and portfolios.</p>

p15140coll45	Essai d'Anatomie	<p>The Essai D'Anatomie was produced by Gautier D'Agoty in 1745 in  Paris, France.  It is a remarkably detailed atlas of the head, neck,  and shoulder areas of the human body with explanatory text in French.  The anatomical images were based on human cadavers dissected by Joseph  Duverney (1) and produced using the mezzotint method of engraving and  printing. </p><p> </p><p>Mezzotint color engraving printing was invented by Jaques Christophe Le Blon in 1719.  Mezzotint (from the Italian phrase mezza tina or half tone)  prints are produced by engraving a metal plate with numerous small  holes that hold ink.  When used to make a print, the engraved plate  produces large areas of subtle shaded color tones.  Since the mezzotint  technique is quite labor-intensive, it fell out of favor by the 20th  century, although it is still utilized by some artists.  Most often used  to reproduce paintings by famous artists, mezzotint printing was rarely  used for original works of art (2), making the Essai D'Anatomie a work of great scientific and artistic significance.</p><p> </p><p>The original copy of the Essai D'Anatomie held by the Rudolph  Matas Library of the Health Sciences at Tulane University was restored,  bound, and digitized by William Kitchens.  The restoration work was  completed on May 6, 2008.  These remarkable anatomical images from the  18th century provide a fascinating look into both the artistic and  scientific climate of the period.</p><p> </p><p> References: </p><p></p><p>1.

p15140coll46	Fonville Winans’ Aerial Views of Baton Rouge	<p></p><p> </p><p>Baton Rouge experienced the onset of rapid growth in the post-World War II years: a number of housing developments were built, in one case as a result of modified war-era pre-fabricated building production facilities; businesses expanded on their existing sites or built new sites; new public, private, and parochial schools rose, and; a new public hospital went up.</p><p>Baton Rouge photographer Fonville Winans shot at least thirteen rolls of 35mm black & white film in 1947 between the months of February and June, inclusive, from his small private airplane. Information in his shot log indicates he intended to sell copies of the images to businesses documented in the images. Fonville noted in the shot log which images sold and which did not, though we have no definitive proof if these notations are complete.This digital collection consists of two series. The first series  is six (6) two-sided ledger book pages listing each of twelve (12) flights with some additional information associated with each frame of the roll of film shot during that flight. Every frame does not necessarily have an associated identification. One additional roll of aerial photographs not listed in the shot log is included in this collection.The second series contains a total of four hundred fifty seven (457) digital reproductions of the 35mm black & white exposures created during the flights listed above. A small number of the original exposures were unusable.For the most part, Fonville flew along the most developed streets in Baton Rouge such as Plank Road, Scenic Highway, Choctaw Street, Florida Street, and Florida Boulevard. He occasionally flew over and photographed areas that were being developed in 1947, such as the Melrose Subdivision – just north of Florida Boulevard and east of North Foster Drive – and the area near the intersection of Florida Boulevard and Airline Highway, which, in 1947, was an “open” area on the verge of development. One roll is entirely devoted to images of the current Louisiana State University campus and vicinity.There are no physical, positive prints of these negatives.Of particular note is the Crawford Homes development in Delmont Place. W. Hamilton Crawford arrived in Baton Rouge in 1941 to start a company that made prefabricated barracks and hospitals for the U. S. war effort.  Following the war, Crawford turned to developing pre-fabricated home subdivisions in Louisiana and elsewhere. Delmont Place is located less than 1 mile southwest of the intersection of Airline Highway and Plank Road bounded by Riley Street (north), Plank Road (east), Shelly Street (south) and, Douglas Avenue (west).Additional new housing developments pictured within this collection are: the Concrete House Project in the Belfair Homes subdivision bounded by Choctaw Drive (north), Martin Avenue (east), Washington Avenue (south), and North 38th Street (west), and; Rittiner Drive housing project built between McGrath Avenue (north), Eugene Street (east), Myrtle Avenue (south), and St Rose Avenue (west). Olive Street and Rittiner Drive pass through the quadrangle described by the streets named above.The campus of Louisiana State University, seeing an influx of World War Two veterans utilizing the benefits of the Servicemen's Readjustment Act of 1944 (commonly known as the GI Bill of Rights), put up war surplus “hutments” just off campus on Nicholson Drive to house married students. Hutments were also installed on campus for faculty housing.New housing was also going in around the City Park, Erie, and University Lakes. Many of these homes were being built by Standard Oil Company (now ExxonMobil) management and other prominent businessmen.It is important to know that a number of changes have taken place in Baton Rouge between 1947 and 2012 when the collection was processed. The most import of those changes in relationship to this collection is two-fold: 1) Street numbering changed as density increased, and; 2) Streets changed names and in some cases ceased to exist.Where possible, image location identifications were created and verified using the following resources:•    city directories for 1947, 1948, and 1949;•    a street map published in 1947, and;•    Google maps.Given the changes in street numbering and street names, anyone using this collection to identify a site using only its current address may not be able to do so. This is especially true regarding the numbering of the homes along East and South Lake Shore Drives and businesses along Florida Street, Florida Boulevard, Government Street, and other streets and avenues paralleling these main streets.In 1947, North 21st Street between Main Street and Choctaw Street continued as such to Choctaw Street. Today, that portion of North 21st Street between Main Street and Choctaw Street has been renamed as a continuation of Scenic Highway. Also in 1947, there was as yet no Acadian Thruway. The following streets, from north to south, were incorporated into Acadian Thruway at some point:•    North 33rd Street from Mohican to Choctaw Drive;•    North 33rd and 34th Streets between Choctaw Drive and North Street;•    Kernan and Margaretta Avenues from North Street to North Boulevard;•    Oakwood Drive from North Boulevard to Government Street; •    Westmoreland Drive from Government Street to Clay Cut Road, and;•    Cleon Avenue from Clay Cut Road to Hundred Oaks Avenue.From Hundred Oaks Avenue south a new road connector was eventually constructed to tie Acadian Thruway into Stanford Avenue. To find an address currently given as Acadian Thruway will require knowing the cross streets between which the building is located. If the current address is on that section of the Thruway between Hundred Oaks Avenue and Stanford Avenue it will not be in this collection as that section of the Thruway did not exist in 1947.Copyright is retained by descendants of the creators in accordance with U.S. copyright law.

FBM	Frank B. Moore Collection	<p>Collection Description</p><p>Frank B. Moore (1869-1957) was a commercial photographer in New Orleans from 1896 until his death on January 21, 1957. Born in Sauk Center, Minnesota, Moore learned his trade in Milwaukee working with the noted photographer Simon Leonard Stein. He had various studios during his sixty-seven year career in New Orleans, including 1008 Canal St. (1896-99), 147 Baronne St. (1900-02), 1001 St. Charles Ave. (1903-06), 1700 St. Charles Ave. (1907-14); 114 ½ Baronne (1915-20); and 1317 Tulane Ae. (1923-58). For a brief time in the mid-920s he also managed a film studio called "Crescent Comedies." Moore married Elizabeth (Bessie) Meade, sister of British artist Sir Arthur Meade, and they had two children: Frank B. (Sonny) Moore, Jr., and Gladys Renya Moore. At various times the whole family was involved in the business. Bessie worked before their marriage as a "retoucher", as president and secretary of the business after they married, and photographer after her husband retired. Frank, Jr., worked as a photographer for a time in the 1930s, while Gladys served as a frequent model for her father, winning many beauty contests in the 1920s, including "Miss New Orleans" in 1926. After Bessie retired, Gladys Moore continued the business until 1972.</p><p>The Frank Moore Collection contains nearly 550 negatives, most of them glass plates, taken from 1915 to 1950. Well over half of the collection consists of individual and group portraits, many featuring performers in costume, musicians, and local schools. The remaining images are of local industrial or commercial subjects and outdoor scenes. The photographs cover all aspects of New Orleans history and culture and offer a rich insight into the fashions, work, landmarks and leisure of the city during these important years.</p><p>(Source: New Orleans States, August 31, 1902; New Orleans Times-Picayune, January 23, 1957; New Orleans City Directories, 1896-1958)</p><p></p><p>Browse All Items in This Collection</p><p>Browse by Subject Terms:</p><p>Browse by Terms in Title:</p><p>To refine your search, click "Advanced Search" at the top of the page.</p>
